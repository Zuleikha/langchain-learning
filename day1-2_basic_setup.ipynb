They have retractable claws and sharp teeth, which they use for hunting and grooming. Cats are known for their ability to purr and meow to communicate with their owners. They are also known for their curiosity and love to explore their surroundings. Cats are generally clean animals and spend a lot of time grooming themselves. They can be very affectionate and form strong bonds with their human companions.\n"
