- **Day 5-7**: Chain Types (Coming Soon)

### Week 2: Data Integration
- Document Loading & Processing
- Vector Stores & Embeddings  
- RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)

### Week 3: Advanced Features
- Memory Systems
- Agents & Tools
- Advanced Chains

## What I've Built

- Connected to OpenAI API
- Created first LLM chains
- Built prompt templates
- Multi-variable templates
- Few-shot learning examples

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Install requirements: `pip install langchain langchain-openai python-dotenv`
3. Add your OpenAI API key
4. Run the notebooks!
