      "Variables in programming are like containers that hold information. They can store different types of data, such as numbers, text, or even lists of items. By giving a variable a name, we can easily refer to and manipulate the data it contains throughout our program. Think of variables as labels that help us keep track of important information while writing code.\n",

      "========================================\n",
      "LESSON:\n",
      "Lesson Title: \"Let's Dive into Python Functions!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Objective: In this lesson, you will learn about Python functions and how they can help streamline your code and make it more efficient.\n",
      "\n",
      "Introduction:\n",
      "- Imagine you are baking a cake. You need to follow a recipe which tells you the steps to take to make a delicious cake. In Python, functions are like recipes that help you perform specific tasks or actions in your code.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is a Function?\n",
      "- A function is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task. Just like how a recipe helps you bake a cake, functions help you perform tasks in your code.\n",
      "\n",
      "Syntax of a Function:\n",
      "- In Python, a function is defined using the \"def\" keyword, followed by the function name and parentheses ().\n",
      "- Inside the parentheses, you can specify parameters that the function can take as inputs.\n",
      "- The code block that performs the task of the function is indented under the function definition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Example:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "def greet(name):\n",
      "    print(\"Hello, \" + name + \"!\")\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Calling a Function:\n",
      "- To use a function, you \"call\" it by using the function name followed by parentheses.\n",
      "- If the function requires parameters, you specify them inside the parentheses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Example:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "greet(\"Alice\")\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Return Statement:\n",
      "- Functions can also return a value back to the caller using the \"return\" statement.\n",
      "- This allows you to store or use the result of the function outside of the function itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Example:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "def add(a, b):\n",
      "    return a + b\n",
      "\n",
      "result = add(3, 5)\n",
      "print(result)\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Conclusion:\n",
      "- Functions are like recipes in Python, helping you perform specific tasks in your code.\n",
      "- By using functions, you can make your code more organized, readable, and efficient.\n",
      "- Practice creating and calling functions to become more comfortable using them in your code.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exercise:\n",
      "- Write a function called \"square\" that takes a number as input and returns the square of that number. Call the function with different numbers to see the results.\n",
      "\n",
      "PRACTICE QUESTION:\n",
      "Create a function called \"square_root_plus_ten\" that takes in a number as an argument and returns the square root of that number plus 10. Write a test case to ensure that the function works correctly for the input value of 25.\n",
      "\n",
      "EVALUATION:\n",
      "EXCELLENT! You have a good understanding of what functions are in Python. Keep up the great work and continue practicing writing and using functions in your code. Well done!\n",
      "\n",
